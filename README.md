Task 1:NUMBER GAME
This is Task 1 of my CodSoft Internship, where I developed a simple number guessing game using Java. The program generates a random number within a given range, and the user has to guess it. Based on the input, the program gives hints like "Too high" or "Too low" until the correct number is guessed.Game provide 4 attempts to guess correct number.
